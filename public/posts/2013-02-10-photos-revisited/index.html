really what got me into computers in the first place. I did have a go at
submitting to <a href=http://www.istockphoto.com/>istockphoto</a> with a few of my
better ones. They were only ever interested in ‘happy people shots’ and I
didn’t like taking pictures of people - so that died off. The next thing was
<a href=http://deviantart.com/>deviantart.com</a> a few years later but I got bored of
that too and closed my account.</p><p>There’s been a serious amount of down time on the photo front and
I&rsquo;ve decide to change that. With my phone I can use sharing services right from
that and geotag photos - add an extra dimension.</p><p>I’ve been looking into <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/92984649@N06/>flickr</a> and
<a href=http://instagram.com/charlieegan3>Instagram</a> and now have both. Instagram
gets a bad rap but quite frankly has the better app. I’ve set up a few IFTTT
recipes to sync new photos to flickr and on to Twitter after that to get round
the Instagram anti-Twitter policy.</p><p>I’m liking it so far and have added one new photo (others taken previously) -
thinking about trying to do one each day - however I doubt there are that many
nice places to photograph on campus!</p></div></section></body></html>
