Camp</a>. Still relatively new to
containers I had a lot to learn, here are some of the most important things I
took away from the day.</p><h2 id=there-are-all-sorts-of-different-types-of-container>There are all sorts of different types of container</h2><p>So far I&rsquo;ve only ever used Docker containers. I knew there were other container
runtimes around but hadn&rsquo;t taken the time to compare them. Mark Shuttleworth&rsquo;s
presentation about &lsquo;Snaps&rsquo;, a sharing container format for application
distribution; Jonathan Boulle&rsquo;s talk on rkt and rktnetes and Dustin Kirkland&rsquo;s
about Linux Containers in a high-performance computing environment all
introduced (to me) a different take on the container idea.</p><p>However, Liz Rice&rsquo;s talk about building a container from scratch was the first
one that really filled in some big blanks in my understanding of the container
definition.</p><h2 id=containers-are-actually-still-pretty-new>Containers are actually still pretty new</h2><p>For some reason I hadn&rsquo;t picked up on just how much still needs doing to fully
deliver on the container promise. There are all sorts of scheduling systems, and
all sorts of things that aren&rsquo;t quite there yet. Ben Firshman&rsquo;s talk about
serverless web apps in Docker showed both gave a glimpse of some cool
possibilities despite some of the current limitations in Docker Swarm.</p><p>Various speakers made reference to OCI and the value that comes from having a
standard.</p><h2 id=other-people-got-fed-up-waiting-on-container-image-pulls>Other people got fed up waiting on container image pulls</h2><p>George Lestaris&rsquo;s talk about the problems and alternatives to layer based image
distribution really got my attention. CernVM-FS & the IPFS apparently offer
something of a solution to superfluous layer pulls, and this is already in use
in Mesoshere? Something I clearly need to read up on.</p><h2 id=there-are-various-benefits-of-containers-in-production>There are various benefits of containers in production</h2><p>I hadn&rsquo;t fully taken on board the other benefits of containers in production.
When playing with Kubernetes I&rsquo;d thought it was fun but perhaps overkill for a
simple Rails app & database. Turns out that using a distributed scheduling
solution, Kubernetes or otherwise, can also give you faster deploys, rollbacks,
monitoring, cheaper hosting among many others with <em>relatively</em> little extra
work.</p><h2 id=persistent-workloads-are-quite-a-bit-more-complex>Persistent workloads are (quite a bit) more complex</h2><p>Some Orchestration tools seem to be missing a clear means of running persistent
workloads. It also seems to be a new feature in those that do. This seems to
line up with my experience of getting a SQL database running. I think I need to
spend some time looking into <a href=https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/postgresql>ways to do this
properly</a>.</p><hr><p>I got a great deal out of the day - lots of really interesting things to test
out and perhaps even contribute to. Really well run event and a great venue.</p></div></section></body></html>
