The motivation for building <a href=https://serializer.io>serializer</a> came from an approaching assignment deadline, rather than cutting out news I thought I&rsquo;d make following it more manageable. For me this meant a sequential feed - I didn&rsquo;t like having to scan the entire ranked list for new items.</p><p><strong>March 6th:</strong> The first working version took around 30 minutes to build and was running on Heroku soon after. This was prior to the new <a href=https://www.heroku.com/beta-pricing>dyno pricing</a>. I used kaffine (discontinued) to keep the site alive.</p><p>I decided on a name pretty quick and bought serializer.io the next day. Students got a discount on <em>.io</em> domains at Namecheap (at the time).</p><p><img src=/posts/2015-05-22-building-and-shipping-my-side-project/v1.jpg alt="Version 1">
<em>Version 1</em></p><p><strong>March 11th:</strong> I read this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9184448">blog post</a> (about &lsquo;shipping&rsquo; side projects) it was probably shared on Hacker News. (edit: it was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9184448">shared on Hacker News</a>).</p><p>I set to adding some extra features. Read-to-Here marker, &lsquo;loginless&rsquo; syncing, pick and choose custom feeds and tweet counts came about pretty quickly.</p><p>At this point I was still the only user of serializer.</p><p>I worked quite hard to get the page weight down. The only javascript on the site is Google Analytics and a timer to refresh the page in the background. The assets are all compressed and images served via <a href=https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_gem>Cloudinary</a>. The feed pages should be around 150kb.</p><p><strong>March 19th:</strong> I posted comments on HN on a few <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9206427">relevant</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9282219">posts</a> and acquired my first regular user (Fort Colins, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 if you&rsquo;re out there!).</p><p><strong>April 2nd:</strong> I added the word count feature (and a save to Trello Reading List feature that&rsquo;s live but isn&rsquo;t really ready for the world yet).</p><p><strong>April 19th:</strong> Switched to a $5 Digital Ocean droplet using <a href=https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt>dokku-alt</a> and made the <a href=https://github.com/charlieegan3/serializer>source public</a>. This was in pursuit of better performance as well as in response to Heroku&rsquo;s pricing changes. serializer is still going strong on the same $5 droplet.</p><p>I took a break for a while after that, only making very minor changes over the exam period when I needed a break from the books. I started using an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/over?points=10">&lsquo;over 10 url&rsquo;</a> for Hacker News and made some other adjustments to marginally reduce the number of collected items. Pressure of exams and all that.</p><p><strong>May 15th:</strong> I added a link to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9462755">points</a>, a cool app I&rsquo;d seen on Product Hunt. I&rsquo;d found it was pretty good at summarising articles wanted make it a feature. I reached out to points and heard back from <a href=https://twitter.com/hjonesr>Hugh Jones</a>, he liked serializer and the points connection and offered to setup a post on <a href=http://www.producthunt.com/posts/serializer-io>Product Hunt</a>.</p><p><strong>May 18th:</strong> serializer did better than I ever expected and finished the day in the top 10 with around 100 votes at the time. Since I hadn&rsquo;t done any promotion before I saw a vast increase in traffic, I was impressed that the droplet held up.</p><p><img src=/posts/2015-05-22-building-and-shipping-my-side-project/trend.jpg alt=trend>
<em>This weeks trend, can you spot the Product Hunt boost?</em></p><p>This in turn led to some really great feedback from Product Hunters on Twitter and via the feedback form. In response to this I&rsquo;ve made the following changes over the last few days:</p><ul><li>Display unread count in the tab title.</li><li>Added an apple-touch-icon.</li><li>Reduce chances of users being assigned the same random session identifier (potential error)</li><li>Revise the feedback page, trying to move over to GitHub Issues and a <a href=https://charlie43.typeform.com/to/tZWtCn>TypeForm</a> for feedback.</li><li>Add some pointers to the <a href=https://github.com/charlieegan3/serializer>GitHub repo</a>.</li><li>Added clarification to the way the session links work. You just need to visit the session path on each browser and then use the site as normal.</li></ul><p>Looking forward, I think serializer is fine where it is. I might add some more sources and tidy things here and there, but nothing major. <strong>I&rsquo;m never going to try and make money from it</strong>.</p><p>It solves a problem for me (and apparently some others too). At the end of the day that&rsquo;s all it needs to do.</p></div></section></body></html>
