<a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21371609>article</a> on by BBC on Script
Kiddies cheating Microtransation systems in games. I found the story
annoying for a number of reasons. The first was the way that ‘offenders’ were
discussed.</p><blockquote><p>Most were written using basic coding languages such as Visual Basic and C#,
and were written in a way that contain quite literal schoolboy errors that
professional hackers were unlikely to make - many exposing the original
source of the code.</p></blockquote><p>First off, C# and Visual Basic can be used to make complex systems. I fail to
see how the readability syntax has any meaning here - bear in mind these
languages may have been the only/most accessible way to implement such a tool.
That doesn’t make them &lsquo;basic’ - MSDN would lap up that tone…</p><p>The <em>11 year old kids</em> made mistakes professional programmers with CS degrees
and years of experience were unlikely to make. Isn’t this a surprise? 11 year
old kids make mistakes in spoken English too and we don’t turn our noses up at
that.</p><blockquote><p>You teach your children that you can’t take a toy without paying - so I think
this type of a message needs to get to the kids when they’re writing software
too.</p></blockquote><p>Okay, digital products can be replicated an infinite number of times - they
have no manufacturing costs.  While it is perhaps wrong that they can get stuff
for free it also brings into question: should developers be able to sell
content in this way? This is up for debate and is currently a subject
I&rsquo;m undecided on.</p><p>I think what is damaging about the article through is it gives kids interested
in programming a bad name, a reason to be watched and worried over. While it’s
not as good as making a website or an app, you’ve got to start somewhere, and
the skills learned will eventually benefit the industry.</p></div></section></body></html>
