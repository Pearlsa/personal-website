projects. Recently I&rsquo;ve had a few free weekends and have completed initial
versions of two new projects.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to write more in the Go language as well as experimenting with
new AWS products. The first project came out of a way to experiment with these.
I generally like to learn new things as part of a project that does something -
this time <em>Borked</em> was what I made.</p><p>I had the idea while I was working on charlieegan3.com. I&rsquo;d introduced a few
broken links as I&rsquo;d migrated the site to different setups over the years. I&rsquo;d
scanned the site with
<a href=https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker>BLS</a> in a docker
container and fixed the links. I also added
<a href=https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer>HTMLProofer</a> to my site to help
stop me introducing any more.</p><p>With that completed, I was on the look out for another project. A concurrent
broken link scanner seemed like a good Go starter project - BLS was quite slow.
The very first version of Borked was a dead simple tool to scan sites for broken
links.</p><p>I came back to it sometime later to build v2.0 - the web version. I&rsquo;d learned
about Go <a href=https://golang.org/pkg/context/>context</a> in the meantime and was also
keen to try out AWS Lambda.</p><p><a href=https://borked.charlieegan3.com><img src=/posts/2017-08-28-back-in-the-side-project-groove/borked.png alt=borked></a>
<em>Borked v2.0</em></p><p>I built Borked with the <a href=https://github.com/eawsy/aws-lambda-go-net>eawsy Go lambda
shim</a> - behind an API
Gateway. The web client is hosted on S3 and cloudfront - I&rsquo;d enabled CORS on the
function endpoint.</p><p>The client makes requests to the function with a root URL. The function must
respond within 30 seconds when behind an API Gateway. I have it configured to
return the results after 10 seconds. The function returns a list of scanned as
well as incomplete links. The web client then sends subsequent requests to
complete all the site&rsquo;s internal links - the function doesn&rsquo;t really have any
representation of a &lsquo;job&rsquo;.</p><p>Storing the progress of the scanning job on the client allows the function to be
quite simple. It&rsquo;s not ideal but it works and seems to work reasonably quickly
too.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to add some extra features to Borked - I&rsquo;d like to allow for
customisations like exclude patterns or User-Agent settings.</p><p>Based on the structure for Borked this weekend I was able to assemble RSSMerge
pretty quickly.</p><p><a href=https://rssmerge.charlieegan3.com><img src=/posts/2017-08-28-back-in-the-side-project-groove/rssmerge.png alt=rssmerge></a>
<em>RSSMerge Homepage</em></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href=https://feedbin.com/>Feedbin</a> as an RSS reader for about 6
months - it&rsquo;s got some good features but I&rsquo;m really looking for a different
setup. I&rsquo;m no longer commuting by train and would rather have a regular roundup
of my followed feeds than trying to keep up with every item in each.</p><p>Creating a merged RSS feed would allow me to get all my feeds as a single
roundup email from IFTTT.</p><p>RSSMerge will take a list of RSS feeds; fetch them; interleave them in order;
remove the content (leaving only the title and link) and return a new RSS feed.
Feeds are again fetched concurrently so it&rsquo;s quite quick (even a list of about
50 feeds only takes a few seconds).</p><p>The list of feeds is passed to the API as a link to a raw Gist. This is a bit of
a hack but it means that RSSMerge doesn&rsquo;t require any state at all. The feed URL
of the RSSMerge feed is just the endpoint + raw feed list parameter. E.g.</p><pre><code>https://rssmerge.cluster.charlieegan3.com/build?source=...
</code></pre><p>(<a href="https://rssmerge.cluster.charlieegan3.com/build?source=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/charlieegan3/9190409c458bc4aa17ef52a8b682aba4/raw/60043038a1c8f668acddb506db58bdc049f144bd/rssmerge_sample">Example link</a>)</p><p>This can be used by IFTTT to create roundups like this:</p><p><img src=/posts/2017-08-28-back-in-the-side-project-groove/roundup.png alt=roundup>
<em>IFTTT Roundup - note multiple feed sources</em></p><p>I have a history of not sticking to a news consumption strategy for more than a
year but we&rsquo;ll see how this goes.</p><p>I think for my next project I&rsquo;m going to make it something longer term. I might
even deliberately avoid projects that could be immediately useful for me. I&rsquo;ve
found that having something I can <em>almost</em> use a little stressful and I&rsquo;ll spend
too many late nights trying to get it working. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s particularly
healthy or productive. Having a project that that was more complicated and
longer term might help keep things more manageable while being a more valuable
learning experience.</p></div></section></body></html>
