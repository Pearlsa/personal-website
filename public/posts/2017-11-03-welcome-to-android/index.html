I&rsquo;ve been wanting a
change of scene and to go back to Android for some time - so far it&rsquo;s going
well. On top of all the benefits I was expecting - improved camera, speed and
customisability over my iPhone 6 - there were a number of other surprising
features that I&rsquo;ve found really helpful.</p><p>The first feature is background tab opening from <em>other apps</em>. I get email news
roundups and open links in them from my email client. This feature allows me to
&lsquo;queue&rsquo; a whole series of links for the next time I open Firefox - without
leaving my email client. There&rsquo;s a little pop-up if I did ever want to open a
link right away.</p><p>Firefox also allows me to set my homepage to open when I open new tabs. I have
built my own page with a series of links I like to start from so having this as
my default new tab page is nice - if a small touch.</p><p>iOS is pretty fast to kill background apps. I often had issues with larger
uploads to Slack and Dropbox. In Android these uploads get a dedicated task and
persistent notification so I can see when and if they complete. No more
returning to a Slack conversation only to find the file never sent. Slack is
noticably faster on Android. Even vs an iPhone 8 which I tried out - I&rsquo;m not
sure what&rsquo;s going on with the iOS slack client&mldr;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve saved the simplest of these &lsquo;windfall&rsquo; features for last. Android has what
is effectively an alt-tab feature activated by double pressing the square menu
button. This is really useful for copying and pasting from 1password. I find
this faster than the iOS browser integration.</p><p>I also haven&rsquo;t even taken my pixel charger out of the box #USBC #future.</p></div></section></body></html>
