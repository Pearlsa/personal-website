I like how, while it’s reasonably
simple, you still get a feel that it’s somehow your own creation. Once you’ve
checked for 10 fingers and toes you though want to push it a little more,  make
it work. You can buy the latest game, £40, and watch the beautiful graphics
bring your computer to its knees, only to get refused refund thanks to the
wonders of modern DRM. Or you could just use a benchmarking tool to check that
it’s up to scratch.</p><p>There are some really nice 3D benchmarks out there - my two favourites would
have to be <a href=http://unigine.com/products/heaven/>Heaven</a> and
<a href=http://www.3dmark.com/>3DMark</a>. They’re both totally free and give you a much
better idea of how well games will perform for real. While games still have the
specs on the back it’s often hard to compare, using a benchmark give much
greater accuracy.</p><p>These tools basically display scenes that challenge the core components and
measure the key factor of smooth game play: frame rate or FPS. Numbers and
scores aside, there are some really nice graphics to watch while
your computer trundles through the tests.</p><p>I know that this may seem kind of obvious but I still get plenty of questions
from people asking how well games will run on their new computers.</p><p>On the topic of benchmarks there is another tool that deserves a mention,
<a href=http://browser.primatelabs.com/user/charlieegan3/geekbench2>Geekbench</a>.
Geekbench doesn’t have a fancy 3D world but instead uses a set of tests
to evaluate CPU and RAM performance. The great thing about Geekbench is a
comparable score, you can run the suite on many devices (even phones and
tablets) and get a meaningful score out of them.</p></div></section></body></html>
