Iâ€™ve mostly been automating backups of my Notion and Dropbox data using GitHub actions. Iâ€™ve also automated my <a href=https://charlieegan3.com/posts/2020-06-06-notion-contacts-list/>contact export</a> from Notion. While we wait for Notion to release a public API, the private API seems to be relatively easy to use for such tasks. GitHub actions isnâ€™t perfect but itâ€™s free and it sends me emails when things break.</li><li>My â€˜mainâ€™ side project at the moment is some kind of â€˜queryable overlayâ€™ populated on data in my Dropbox. The idea is to be able to search for photos based on their location and other EXIF data - as well as perhaps eventually faces and other smarts. Iâ€™m interested to know what my highest altitude photo is, for example.</li><li>At <a href=https://preflight.jetstack.io/>work</a> Iâ€™ve been trying to understand how to represent severity of warnings raised about clusters and things running in them. There are many different dimensions: security, availability considerations; how confident we are that weâ€™re right; and how much impact the worst case scenario has.</li><li>I also had some really valuable feedback from a senior colleague on a design proposal I&rsquo;d written. I&rsquo;ve never really had feedback on that before and found it to be really helpful. I&rsquo;m planning to write the notes as a blog post.</li><li>AFK, Iâ€™ve been for two swims at the <a href=http://parliamenthilllido.org/>Parliament Hill Lido</a>. Pleasantly surprised at both how close and how clean it is. I am thinking of buying a <a href="https://uk.roka.com/collections/mens-wetsuits/products/mens-maverick-comp-ii-wetsuit?variant=13603914743919">wetsuit</a> however as I canâ€™t really stay in there for more than 20 mins safely. My feeling is that itâ€™ll only get colder&mldr;</li><li>Last weekend someone tried to snatch my phone so I bought a cheaper backup iPhone 5SE. I was really impressed by the nearby device <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210216>quick start feature</a>. I also bought what is effectively a <a href="https://www.quadlockcase.co.uk/collections/accessories/products/phone-ring-stand?variant=31349703573619">Â£14 keyring</a> for my Quad Lock case.</li><li>Back at work, the video calling arms race continues and I got sucked into it this week after <a href="https://twitter.com/_jsfuentes?s=21">someone</a> sent me a link to a Â£6 capture card on eBay&mldr;</li></ul><p><img src=Screenshot_from_2020-08-31_18-11-35.png alt=Screenshot_from_2020-08-31_18-11-35.png></p><ul><li>Iâ€™ve booked my trains home for Christmas. Booked to visit my granny for the first time this year. And tried to book a trip to Edinburgh but LNER said not yet.</li><li>Weâ€™ve been playing Sea of Thieves. We all find the controls infinitely frustrating and still canâ€™t seem to beat any other ships with real players in them. That said, we still seem to enjoy it, firing people out of canons and drinking grog is fun too.
