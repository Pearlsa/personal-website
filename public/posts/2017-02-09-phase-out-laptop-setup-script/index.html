Recently, a number of factors have pushed me to consider alternatives, the reasons for which are beyond the scope of this post. The consequence is that I&rsquo;ve been looking to port my development environment to a Linux workstation.</p><p>I have a dotfiles repository on GitHub. This contains a number of config files for programs that I use use such as bash and vim. It also includes bootstrap script for setting up a developer laptop on MacOS and I&rsquo;ve used this laptop bootstrap script to save me multiple hours on more than one occasion. However - recently, I&rsquo;ve come to see it as something of a burden that&rsquo;s a pain to maintain and makes me less adaptable.</p><p>My bootstrap script installs Homebrew packages, casks and configured the OS just the way I liked it. This won&rsquo;t work on Linux. I&rsquo;ve also decided that I no longer want to automate this task but rather alter the way I work to make it irrelevant. To get to this point I&rsquo;ve had to make some key changes:</p><ul><li>Using a command line text editor (2015)</li><li>Using docker and compose</li><li>Replacing tools that require a native app, e.g. Day One</li><li>Implementing some self hosted tools</li><li>Using a web based password manager</li><li>Hosting my own bookmarks</li><li>Using a cross platform browser like Firefox (2017)</li></ul><p>If that list doesn&rsquo;t make it clear, I&rsquo;ll state it upfront: <strong>this isn&rsquo;t a guide to setting up your development environment but rather a justification for a change I&rsquo;m making to mine</strong>. So why ditch the bootstrap script? I don&rsquo;t think I need one. I&rsquo;ve spent some free time arriving at the following setup, again - this is largely enabled by the changes implemented in the list above.</p><ol><li>Install the Manjaro i3 distro. i3&rsquo;s config files and keybindings really resonated with me, this was the first distro I found that bundled i3. Sure it&rsquo;s easy to install i3 over an Ubuntu system but I like pacman & this new setup is all about making use of sensible defaults already available.</li><li>Install Firefox and sync settings (side note, FF extensions don&rsquo;t sync settings well - reduce dependencies on them where possible, also).</li><li>Import my GPG and ssh keys.</li><li>Clone my config files repo into my home directory.</li><li>Install docker.</li></ol><p>Looking at that list, would you bother to write a script for that? I&rsquo;ve decided I don&rsquo;t need to.</p></div></section></body></html>
