However, My
phone and laptop both have a disabled setting in common: <em>Automatically Adjust
Brightness</em>. It <em>should</em> be a useful feature. It’s not for me - and seems
to only create a distraction. When you’re sitting still it’s fine (perfectly
still) - it may even count as useful. However as soon as you move around the
display practically flashes to compensate for what is <em>perceives</em> as new
lighting conditions.</p><p>It’s the rate of change that’s the problem - at least slow it a little! The
controller for this feature seems happy to make swinging adjustments almost
continuously. I need some more options:</p><ul><li>The option to set boundaries on the variation. For example don’t set at
greater than 80% or less than 20%.</li><li>Also a setting on the sensitivity - just the option to tone down the rapid
reactions a little. Only after a significant change in lighting make the
change.</li><li>Rate of Change. The setting to reduce the maximum &lsquo;speed’ at which the
brightness can change. Set lower this would hopefully give a
more gradual adjustment in brightness and in turn be less distracting.</li><li>The option to <strong>turn it off</strong> is the also essential - lets hope it stays.</li></ul></div></section></body></html>
