<a href=https://ifttt.com/>IFTTT</a>. IFTTT is an online automation service that brings
together many online applications. Before I begin there is some IFTTT jargon
that you should know:</p><ul><li>Channel: An application that you have ‘linked’.</li><li>Trigger: An event that a Channel has. <em>e.g. &lsquo;New Mail Received’.</em></li><li>Action: A task that a Channel can complete automatically.</li><li>Recipe: A combination of a Trigger and an Action.</li></ul><p>To give you a feel two of my current recipes are: Post a link to all my new blog
posts on Twitter and Add an event to my &lsquo;Places&rsquo; calendar whenever I check in on
<a href=https://foursquare.com/charlieegan3>Foursquare</a>. All the recipes I use are
also used by others, there’s a sharing feature, however I’ve made modifications
to suit. Custom recipes are also really easy to set up.</p><p>I mentioned not so long ago about logging my music - this system has some
flaws. It only accounts for the dates the files were created and doesn’t keep a
log of every single track you play during a day. However, with the help of the
last.fm and Google Drive APIs, I have now solved this problem with IFTTT. A
simple Recipe is now triggered every time I play a song, it’s action being to
log the song, artist and time in a spreadsheet.</p><p>There are a few minor issues with the service, but none come close to being
major. </p><ul><li>It’s only as good as the APIs it uses. By this I mean: If an API is weak,
lacking in features or none existent
(<a href=https://twitter.com/adamjwray/status/293896078686818304>Google+</a>) there
is nothing you can really do. There are a few work arounds with &lsquo;Send and
Email to Add’ features but they are often far from perfect and fail to
accomplish anything close to the functionality of a powerful API.</li><li>Multi Action Recipes. Perhaps best explained with an example: I have three
recipes where Blogger is the trigger, all with different actions. Surely it
would be more efficient to group these? Say, when this happens, do these
three things - that just seems more natural to me.</li><li>The site’s interface is nice, however it should have a &lsquo;condensed view’ for
viewing your recipes. It’s as if they only ever expected people to have a
handful of recipes. It would be nice to have a more tabular view available
for those users with more recipes.</li></ul><p>If you’ve read though this and still don’t really understand what it’s all
