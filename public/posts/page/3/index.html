Update You can try the project here. Code available here.
Update 2 I have taken down the live demo - there are now many apps that make this easy on phones.

My last post explained about how I create backups of my Instagram posts. I had a few people ask about why this was useful. Other than the Instagram doomsday-scenario, in it&rsquo;s current form (a git repo with some images and JSON metadata) it wasn&rsquo;t.

I enjoy using Instagram to share my photos. The restricted feature-set; public-by-default; similarities to Twitter & (original) square format constraint all appeal.
Last year I completed a #365photochallenge on Instagram.

For a series of reasons I recently bought a Google Pixel 2. I&rsquo;ve been wanting a change of scene and to go back to Android for some time - so far it&rsquo;s going well.

Since starting work full-time I&rsquo;ve been lacking the energy and time for side projects. Recently I&rsquo;ve had a few free weekends and have completed initial versions of two new projects.

terraform destroy has been a game changer for my public cloud toy projects. Building up a reproduceable config that can brought straight back the next time you come to work on the project is invaluable.

I was in the market for a project to spend some more time with Terraform when I saw this prompt in the AWS console. Terraform can do all those things & I have a static site (this site) that I could use to test it out.

We were recently tasked with adding a feature that showed the status of a IoT device as it changed. It was important that the status page updated quickly; and given weâ€™d recently upgraded to Rails 5, this was a prime opportunity to learn ActionCable.

After working closely with a proficient vim user on a summer internship; I started experimenting with vim during the summer of 2015. I made the usual mistakes of copying the other&rsquo;s vimrcs and installing too many plugins - I think everyone has to go though that phase though.
