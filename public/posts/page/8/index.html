I mentioned a few posts back that I was going to try and get back into taking some photos again - mainly just a a little log of where I’ve been.

I’ll first describe how things worked at Dingwall Academy, my secondary school. There was a proxy server that all web traffic went through - it ran Websense.

Devices are getting smarter and this helps us most of the time. However, My phone and laptop both have a disabled setting in common: Automatically Adjust Brightness.

I used to take quite a few photos - digital photography and Photoshop were really what got me into computers in the first place. I did have a go at submitting to istockphoto with a few of my better ones.

The topic of online discussion interests me. Talk to who you want, about what interests you and in a way that you like. While I think there are probably enough places to take part in the discussion I think we need at least one more :method of structuring that conversation.

This little adjustment has probably saved me hours over the past few months and is a must for any programmer.
Open_ System Preferences._ Open the Keyboard preference pane.

I’m quite interested in an app called Summly, what originally interested me was the coverage on BBC. I guess I was surprised by his age. In an interview he talks about how he came up with the idea, it seems the idea was, originally, merely a search enhancement I think Summly is great, however the problem described in search remains unsolved.
