The problem of how to enforce licensing is a big one and one that certainly deserves our attention. Many are trying new methods to license their products.

Recently I’ve had to put in some really long shifts at the computer to get some coursework done. It’s done now but at its peak I was spending up-to 10 hours a day sitting at the computer.

One of the games I like to play is called Frozen Synapse. It’s a turn based strategy game that lends it’s self nicely to competitive play.

At school, and now university, it seems trendy to have lower level assessments sat via computer - students like it for the instant results and teachers love the absence of any real marking.

The subtle iPod Shuffle often gets overlooked, and rarely spends time in the spotlight. This is because it has, as a class of device, truly fulfilled it’s purpose as the simplest music player.

-
Apps Store have changed the face of the software market. They serve up content cheaply and consistently. While the content they provide may be better than ever, the stores themselves just aren’t up to scratch.

Computer dictation is something I’ve spent a much time trying out. Sadly, it’s been a let down but not due to poor accuracy.
Things are fine when it’s only you for miles around, alone and productive.

We had a computer when I was very young - I can hardly remember - it broke and was never replaced. When you’re that age you don’t think anything of it - just get on with life, forget about it the next day.

There are some great apps out there that really don&rsquo;t get enough recognition - CodeRunner is my personal favourite of that description.
We&rsquo;ve all used the command line to run code, we&rsquo;ve also used a full blown IDE - but CodeRunner is something special.
