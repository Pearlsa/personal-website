I started lurking on Hacker News and Product Hunt at the beginning of the year. The motivation for building serializer came from an approaching assignment deadline, rather than cutting out news I thought I&rsquo;d make following it more manageable.

I’ve tried time and time again to make following tech news work for me. It seems to be an inordinately tough problem (for me) to solve (for myself).

I recently finished reading Masters of Doom by David Kushner and thought I’d write a short response. It’s the first book I’ve read from start to finish since I was a child.

I’ve been trying to cut down on the time I spend reading news for a long time, I even built my own Ruby news aggregator and summariser.

I’ve spent most of the week (a series of 12 hour days) working with a web application called vend. It’s a program of my own selection and I was keen to get it working in the small business before I go back to university.

Lately I’ve been playing quite a bit of Mass Effect 3, namely the multiplayer. It’s been good fun and I’ve gotten a lot more into it than I did last time - I’ve enjoyed taking on the more difficult levels with friends.
