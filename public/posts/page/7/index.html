My first year at university came to an end yesterday at 11:30 when I finished my ‘Web Technology’ exam. It’s been a fast few months but in that time I feel I’ve learnt enough to have an opinion on the university way.

I like recording things. Spending so much time online there is a vast amount of activity for me to log - I thought I’d have a go, in the future it might be quite interesting.

While I send the majority of emails and communication by typing out messages on a Qwerty keyboard I’m sending more and more from my phone by the week.

Gamification is a new word for me, even while the concept isn’t. Gamification is the process of implementing a social system that borrows elements from video games.

Online assessments are have become a big part of life since my move to university last year. They’re typically in the form of a web based questionnaire that are accessible via the university student portal.

Keymonk was really great and it felt like a truly innovative product. A few weeks ago I read this and decided it was time for a change once again.

I recently downloaded Umano. It’s an app that gives you access to spoken news on your mobile device. I get most of my news via twitter these days, and while I’m quite happy with that system it’s sometimes nicer to get a little more depth.

I about a week ago I read a an article on by BBC on Script Kiddies cheating Microtransation systems in games. I found the story annoying for a number of reasons.
