recognition - <a href=http://krillapps.com/coderunner/>CodeRunner</a> is my personal
favourite of that description.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve all used the command line to run code, we&rsquo;ve also used a full blown IDE -
but CodeRunner is something special. CodeRunner lets you write and run in many,
totally different languages and all from the same sleek window.</p><p>Hit play to run - instantly, choose the syntax from a drop down - made just so
perfectly simple. And from simplicity comes speed and greater productivity.</p><p>As an example. For one of my courses we were given Ruby assignment.
I think because the tutors wanted everyone to be on the same system they told
us that we needed to do it through a virtual machine. Just crazy - you can run
Ruby on Windows, Mac and Linux - and of course everyone goes ahead and sets up
the virtual machine leading to many more problems… For me and CodeRunner though
it was as simple as just typing code away into one app - naively! For me there
was no buggy virtualisation, no over baked text editors - just one clean window
for every task.</p><p>What’s great though is the same solution worked for my python assessment too,
just so simple to switch language.</p></div></section></body></html>
