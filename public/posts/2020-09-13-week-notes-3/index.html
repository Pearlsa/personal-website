This is not something that I’ve done in a big way before so I’m enjoying learning something new and getting feedback on them. One thing I’m still not sure how to balance is when to actually make a start&mldr; I guess I’ll get there are I do more of them as part of my work.</li><li>I went for another swim (with wetsuit!). I stayed for the full length of the session (about 45 minutes of swimming after 15 mins of getting the suit on!). It seems like it’s too cold for most to stay the full hour so for the last 10 minutes I had the whole lane to myself which, on a lovely summer’s evening, felt like quite the luxury.</li><li>I took two days off from running and biking at the start of the week. I just needed a break really after a pretty big week. This turned into a generally more chill week&mldr; I did get some new shoes very much like the old ones though.

It seemed to work ok for me but one of our party was unable to join. We’re all enjoying being able to play together with Games Pass but the relentless multi gigabyte updates and coordinating these in the group is starting to take it’s toll. It’s hard enough to find a time we can all manage, let alone make sure we’ve all left consoles ages to finish downloads. This week we got stung by a Sea of Thieves update that landed just as we were about to play - very frustrating experience all round really.</li><li>I’ve been keeping a little todo list of things to fix and add to my website. This week I’ve mostly been working on improvements to the search feature. Now as you search matches within pages, posts, projects and profile are shown highlighted. I’ve been using <a href=https://lunrjs.com/>lunr.js</a>. It’s default stemmer, trimmer and stopwords list weren’t working, so I opted to turn them off. I suspect that this works for me with a relatively small set of documents where I have some knowledge of their contents and can manually check the results.</li><li>About 2 years ago I bought a Patagonia jacket before taking a trip to Copenhagen. I really loved the jacked and wore it so much that it wore through in the back panel. I was delighted to get the jacket repaired free of charge.
