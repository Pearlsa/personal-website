to choose what to program with when there isn’t any real project. It’s just you
and some spare time.</p><p>I first learnt to program in VB.Net - in some ways it’s a good place to start.
You can easily create programs that look ‘real’, you can run them on most
Windows boxes and they are basically good fun.</p><p>Still, you can’t run them <strong>everywhere</strong> and the idea that it’s hard to show
everyone your creation has always bothered me somewhat. I had never really
thought about web applications until recently when I covered them on my course
and they appear to be the answer to my sharing problem.</p><p>If they taught this kind of programming/development at school and equipped
pupils with a free web host then I think there would be a great deal more
interest. Parents would be able to see what there kids were creating and I
think this would lead to a greater interest in computing as a subject.</p><p>So on that note I think web, and web applications, is where I’m headed - I
think it’s the answer to my long standing cross platform development problem.</p><p>I’ve bought a really nice app called <a href=http://macrabbit.com/espresso/>Espresso</a>
from <a href=http://macrabbit.com/>MacRabbit</a> on special offer that does lots of the
boring stuff for me.</p><p>I’ll be spending my spare time over the next few months learning more about web
related things.</p></div></section></body></html>
