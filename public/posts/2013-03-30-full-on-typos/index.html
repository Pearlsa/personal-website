a Qwerty keyboard I’m sending more and more from my phone by the week. I’m also
using dictation to type longer documents when I’m alone. On my phone I use a
the Swype keyboard, I swear by gesture based typing in fact. However Dictation
and Gesture Based Typing can lead to some pretty bad typos.</p><p>Originally there mistkes would look like that, missing or swapped letters and
bad punctuation. Now though spelling mistakes are taking on a new form. I’ll
use an example, I wanted to text a friend that I was: “Just heading off now”. I
was in a rush, I was about a minute or two on the late side and I wrote the
text out quickly. This, lead to me typing: “Just getting off now.”. Wonderful
isn’t it?</p><p>Perfectly formed, our new error-ridden sentences are much harder to decipher
and scan for errors. Mis-typed words have no mistakes, no missing letters -
it’s as if we’re not trained to spot errors of this kind. I guess in days gone
by we would have seen each word as it was typed. During typing would normally
be the best time to spot if you’re typing a completely different word…</p><p>These new ‘lazy’ methods remove that first microscopic proof reading we make -
completely. Dictation is the worst, it’ll buffer your whole sentence before
splurging the whole lot out, ready for more text. This means you just skim the
<strong>whole</strong> sentence, rather than each word, often, in my case leading to some
significant errors in my text.</p><p>I’m not saying this is a critical flaw, far from it, I enjoy these new ways of
typing. It’s just an observation of a change, one that seems to require
new skill in proof reading to fix.</p></div></section></body></html>
