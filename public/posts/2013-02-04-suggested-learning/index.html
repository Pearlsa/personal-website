<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA>XNA</a> with C# on PC, it was how I
spent my spare time back then. Year year I’ve spending a large amount of time
with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails>Ruby on Rails</a>. I’d say that
in many ways I’m enjoying Rails more - partly because I can see how it includes
a broader skill set (HTML, CSS, JavaScript…). I’m finding it harder to learn
though. There is a need to be continually connected to the internet just to
look up the syntax and error messages that come with every minute of work. With
C# I didn’t have a book but I did have Visual Studio.</p><p>Visual Studio has one big bonus over my
<a href=/posts/2012-12-18-sublime-service>current</a>
<a href=http://macrabbit.com/espresso/>setup</a> - <em>real</em> code completion.</p><p>This made experimentation as a learner a huge amount more successful. It would
always be guessing at what you might want to do - working away to beat you to
it. This not only made it faster when you’d got the idea but it
helped enormously when you didn’t quite know what you were doing. As long as
you got the start right it would often point out the rest (with the help of
some educated guessing).</p><p>In terms of the languages themselves there’s very little in it - they are
quite similar to look at (although I would say that I find C# more readable).
It’s just the tools available that set them apart. I’m getting to grips with it
but I think that it will be a little while before I can write my own code
rather than just adjusting and piecing together code from various tutorials.</p></div></section></body></html>
