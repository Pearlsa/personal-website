Academy</a>, my secondary school. There was a
proxy server that all web traffic went through - it ran
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websense>Websense</a>. The same filtering software
ran at Guantanamo Bay. It’s configuration blocked much of the
useful internet. This was a constant pain for us students and there was much
time spent bribing supply teachers for their logins (the only way we could get
round the problem!).</p><p>The level of filter must have been set to max for every category. There was no
<em>Japan</em> in geography and no <em>pixels</em> in computing. Risqué terms like that never
made it through. It wasn’t the keywords that were the problem, it was more the
broader category blocks such as: forums, youtube and webmail that were the
problem.</p><p>Some of these categories could have provided some very useful information for
many of my subjects - but such a resource may as well have not existed.</p><p>The one that bothered me the most was the “message boards and forums”. Under
this category were: Stackoverflow and MSDN - two crucial resources for a 6th
year computing student. It would have been useful at times to have access
to youtube as well - all were locked down like they were the pages of
criminals.</p><p>I think this failure of a system came about from a fundamental lack of
understanding in two areas: the internet at a resource, the nature of skills
taught in some subjects (namely computing in my case).</p><p>It was clear to see how blocking tactic that had been employed - it might as
well have been a whitelist it was that bad. Someone had thought of everyplace
that a pupil <em>could</em> waste time and just blocked it without any consideration
as to what good could and would come from the resource. YouTube is the perfect
example here, true it’s a top spot for time wasting but the number of
educational videos or videos of internet is staggering. In the same way it’s up
to the teacher to stop pupils chatting it’s up to them to stop time wasting
online. The blanket blocking can take innocent casualties too, like MSDN. Few
waste time there and those that do should, perhaps, be encouraged to do so!</p><p>The other problem is that to know what not to block it’s important to
understand the kinds of materials that are needed for each subject. Forums and
discussion boards are key here. Programming basics rarely come from
books anymore and tools like stackoverflow offer a much better problem
orientated resource for those past the basics. To the untrained eye however it
looks like a rather well built nerd chatroom - which in turn get’s it its
blocked status. Tragic.</p><p>Now I visit stackoverlfow as much as I like. Looking back I should likely have
pushed to have had the filtering adjusted&mldr;</p></div></section></body></html>
