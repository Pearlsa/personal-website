It’s an interesting concept with great variation in it’s implementation. I’ll
discuss the differences in sharing on Android, OSX and Windows 8.</p><p>Android is the only place that I’ve really made <em>any</em> use of a share feature.
It’s used primarily for passing content between applications on the device
itself rather than to an external service. I mainly tend to use it as an &lsquo;open
with’ feature - however it’s a little more than that. It’s context sensitive
and handles different file types very well. It’s closer to the combination of
copy + paste and open with really - it’s good and is a truly useful feature.
The only issue I would raise is the lack of the option to hide sharing targets.
It would be nice to be able to hide them as you can hide the
applications themselves, however it seems this is <a href=http://forums.androidcentral.com/general-help-how/32716-how-do-i-edit-my-share-options.html>not
possible</a>.</p><p>While <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop>Airdrop</a> itself was actually a new
feature for 10.7 Lion, &lsquo;sharing’ wasn&rsquo;t brought centre stage  until last year
with Mountain Lion. For me these new options have been crippled by poor
behaviour under proxy servers and the lack of any API for 3rd party developers.
It would be nice to be able to share pictures to Google+ in the same way I do
on my phone but I guess we’ll just have to wait (or not) for that. I think
Apple’s &lsquo;walled garden’ trend is damaging user experience, it’s certainly
damaged mine. The awkward foibles of the iOS methodology are slowing creeping
in, lets just hope they don’t cripple the mac.</p><p>One of the reasons behind my lack of experience with the Windows 8 &lsquo;share
<a href=http://winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-feature-focus-charms-142999>charm</a>’
is due to the lack of  support. It lacks sources and targets for share actions.
This, as with many other features of the new OS, is it’s downfall. I would say,
however, that it has a much greater potential than that of OSX.</p><p>I would say the separating factor is (near) global visibility. Share is
<em>everywhere</em> on Android, this helps familiarise users with the feature and
makes them more confident to use it. Windows Charms are good too, perhaps even
better setup than android, however the lack of targets turns
great ingenuity into nothing. OSX tails behind, crippled by lack of 3rd party
support and restricted access to the feature.</p></div></section></body></html>
