It’s been good fun and I’ve gotten a lot more into it than I did last time -
I’ve enjoyed taking on the more difficult levels with friends. I really like
the game and I’ll keep playing it for a good while yet - however I really
dislike their levelling up implementation.</p><p>It’s the random element to it that I hate, I really dislike the idea that
you’re not in direct control of how to level up. In games you earn credits and
they can be spent on ‘packs’ - these contain semi-randomly assigned pieces of
kit and unlocks. There are different types of packs, allowing you to vaguely
steer out your path but there’s still next to no control. Basically you have to
put up with what you get - there’s no player influence what so ever. </p><p>I don’t think they’ve done it to be different or original either - I think
they’re just trying to make it addictive. The chance element keeps you coming
back - I guess they hope that sometimes that involves spending some Microsoft
points to fast track. It’s like trading card packs - you might get the best
player in the league or the god card, but most likely you’ll only get rubbish
or cards you don’t want.</p><p>Not only do I think it’s marginally exploitative but I don’t l also dislike the
lack of any foresight or goal. In other games you save up for certain items -
Mass Effect 3 lacks the motivation of a long term goal. I think this is really
important to keep me interested, and is perhaps the reason I stopped playing
the first time round.</p><p>Once you’ve got a few good weapons and characters the gameplay is very good,
and great fun to play with friends. It’s just all the time spent in the lobby,
out of game, that really lets the experience down.</p></div></section></body></html>
