As we walked around I found myself enjoying the
little differences more than anything else. Since returning, I&rsquo;ve found myself
talking about them a lot and thought it&rsquo;d make for quite a good alternative
write up of the trip.</p><p>(if you&rsquo;re interested in seeing some selected pictures, you can find them on my
<a href=https://photos.charlieegan3.com/archive/month/2019-09>photos site</a>)</p><h2 id=the-doors-on-the-left-side-will-open>The doors on the left side will open</h2><p>We made pretty good use of the metro in both Tokyo and Osaka in quite a short
space of time. The summary here is that it&rsquo;s an amazingly easy set of
interconnected systems that runs like clockwork, as expected. Some features I
particularly liked&mldr;</p><ul><li><p>Ticket gates are open when you arrive. Scanning the IC card is instant and the
barriers don&rsquo;t need to close if you have enough money. The barriers only close
if there is a problem. This makes moving a crowd through a set of gates much
faster than in London where gates sometimes take longer to open than others
and require you to stop walking.</p></li><li><p>Some older trains have a special design of seat that can be flipped to make a
reasonably comfy seat for both directions of the route or to make a group of
facing seats. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxDrPeb2mxs">video
here</a> of a similar more modern
design in Sydney.</p></li><li><p>The TFL map is famous for being easy to use, however one thing I&rsquo;d love
help with is navigating complex underground stations such as Bank or Green
Park. I think the main problem is that it&rsquo;s hard to picture how the tunnels
connect in 3D space.</p><p>This is something many stations in Japan had sorted - I think they&rsquo;re a work
of art.</p><p><img src=map.jpg alt="map of station"></p></li><li><p>For quite a long time before the doors are about to close a nice little
jingley tune plays.</p></li><li><p>There is excellent signage on the platforms to explain how to get on and off
the train. In London we are still very bad at this deceptively simple task.</p><p><img src=on-off.png alt="on off signage on platform">
<em>this is where you stand for this door</em></p><p><img src=where-to-wait.jpg alt="where to wait">
<em>this is how you choose where to wait based on the destination stop</em></p></li><li><p>There is amazing support for wheelchair users. We saw two station staff arrive
30s before the train arrived, stand at exact spot for the correct door,
and prepare a ramp. When the train arrived the wheelchair user was there ready
and the staff helped them off the train without any delay to the train. TFL is
getting better but this simple system was amazingly effective too.</p></li><li><p>In Osaka, many of the subway cars had holding handles at three different
heights for different heights of passenger.</p></li><li><p>Something that was confusing for us was that some trains turn into trains for
other lines when they get to a central station, and you can just remain on the
train.</p></li><li><p>Dot matrix indicators have better resolution, colors, etc. We just have
orange&mldr;</p></li></ul><h2 id=was-there-a-peach-fanta-in-that-one>Was there a peach fanta in that one?</h2><p>While playing real life pokemon to collect our favorite soft drinks we covered
quite a lot of ground on foot too.</p><p><img src=wat-machine.jpg alt="strangely located vending machine">
<em>vending machine in the middle of a residential area with very few people
around</em></p><p>Random street-based observations follow&mldr;</p><ul><li><p>Some busy streets have directional pavement lanes - sadly they didn&rsquo;t seem to
be very effective.</p></li><li><p>Public spaces generally have much greater availability of seating.</p></li><li><p>Some areas have amazing painted manhole covers. Like this one near the instant
ramen museum in Osaka.</p><p><img src=chick-ramen.jpg alt="ramen chicken manhole cover"></p></li><li><p>Using horns in cars seems to be much less common. Streets are generally quiet
in comparison.</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s frowned upon to use your phone while walking along. People do it but it&rsquo;s
far less common. I found myself trying to stop and use my phone instead.</p></li><li><p>In Osaka, it seems one can cycle anywhere, pavement, road, crowded shopping
centre. Watch out for them but they&rsquo;re probably already watching out for you.</p></li><li><p>There are chair lifts in some public spaces to help with steps. This isn&rsquo;t
very common but I did notice this in a few different places. I wonder if
this would be possible without vandalism here&mldr;</p></li></ul><h2 id=shinkansen>Shinkansen</h2><p><img src=tea.jpg alt="strange boi waiting for train">
<em>waiting for the train experience of my life - refreshing drink in hand</em></p><ul><li>Each row of train seats lines up with a window. oh. my. gawd. Sure, we have
bigger windows but our trains still feel more claustrophobic and dark. I love
looking out the window while travelling so this was a win for me.</li><li>We might have missed something but it seems there&rsquo;s a set rate for the trains
for each route. We paid about Â£120 to go from Tokyo to Osaka and it didn&rsquo;t
seem to make any difference how far we looked ahead. I&rsquo;d take predictability
of over the mess we have but I still think there are better ways to price
tickets than either system.</li><li>Shinkansen drivers dress like pilots - seems appropriate for a train who&rsquo;s
ancestry is based largely on aeroplane design.</li><li>All coaches are quiet coaches. If you want to make a call then you can just
walk to the vestibule area. People play by the rules too, unlike the fuckers
that chat in the quiet coach here&mldr;</li><li>Arrow displays light up to say which side to alight while the train approaches
the platform. There is also an announcement when the stop will not last long
and encourages people to prepare to exit around 10 mins before the train
stops. We stopped for just over 2 mins in Nagoya.</li><li>Passengers leaving the train take rubbish and bin it on platform. This matches
the general rule of taking rubbish home with you. I really appreciated this
too.</li><li>Shinkansen trains have numbers like flights. This number is printed on your
ticket. While it&rsquo;s a small touch, it makes it easy to know you&rsquo;re on exactly
the right train.</li></ul><p><img src=knees.jpg alt="space for my knees">
<em>look at all that space for my knobbly knees!</em></p><h2 id=please-feel-free-to-use-a-toilet>Please feel free to use a toilet</h2><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the rest of us were doing while the Japanese were designing
their toilets but we got a long way behind. Many have heated seats and
some even play music.</p><p><img src=poop-tunes.jpg alt="toilet that plays music"></p><p>Relative to my experience of finding public toilets in the UK, public toilets in
Japan are <em>everywhere</em>. They are mostly very clean and well looked after if not
modern. Foam soap (to reduce the amount of waste) is much more common, while
hand dryers are much less so. I noticed (after some time) that many carry a
small hand towel with them - I&rsquo;ve tried to make this a habit of my own too.
This means I don&rsquo;t need to use hand dryers (I hate hand dryers but that&rsquo;s
another post&mldr;).</p><p><img src=handtowel.jpg alt="my bullet train handtowel">
<em>my bulltet train themed hand towel from the Kyoto rail museum</em></p><p>In the UK there are &lsquo;public&rsquo; toilets in places like pret. However, locked unless
you buy something and get the code on the receipt. In Japan, having a toilet was
something to bring people in. Feel free, don&rsquo;t mind if I do!</p><p><img src=free-toilet.jpg alt="shop advertising toilet"></p><h2 id=would-it-be-ok-to-have-the-bill-so-we-can-start-waiting-for-the-card-machine>Would it be OK to have the bill so we can start waiting for the card machine?</h2><p>In Japan they don&rsquo;t seem to have that dance at the end of the meal out. When you
are ready to go you just walk up, pay, and leave. I appreciated that. Bells on
tables were also a great idea.</p><p>Eating while walking around was also not a thing - we learned that people just
think you&rsquo;re strange if you do. To help with this, even in little corner shops
(Family Mart etc) they often have a small table areas and even a sink to wash
your hands with after eating (things purchased in their shop).</p><p>Some things didn&rsquo;t make much sense to me though&mldr; like these pre-fried chips&mldr;</p><p><img src=fries.jpg alt="refrigerated fries"></p><p>or this bum beer</p><p><img src=bum-beer.jpg alt="bum advert for beer"></p><p>this salad</p><p><img src=breakfast.jpg alt="salad at breakfast"></p><p>or this small butter child advert</p><p><img src=butter-child.jpg alt="butter child on toast ad"></p><h2 id=is-that-it>Is that it?</h2><p>Nope, I&rsquo;m going back but not sure when.</p><p>Some more photos that didn&rsquo;t really fit above&mldr;</p><p><img src=bag-vending.jpg alt="vending machine selling handmade bags">
