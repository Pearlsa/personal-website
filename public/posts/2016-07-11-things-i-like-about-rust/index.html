I have implemented a dependency graph query tool as part of this approach; the application&rsquo;s Rust component. This is short post about some things I&rsquo;ve enjoyed about Rust so far.</p><h2 id=cargo>Cargo</h2><p>Coming from Ruby, Bundler is a tough act to follow. I&rsquo;ve never needed had to push the edges on Bundler or Cargo but Cargo absolutely feels of a comparable quality. As part of my project I implemented a crate for querying a generic graph. Cargo made this process really easy. This is more than connecting and publishing to crates.io, cargo is the whole picture - running tests & compiling too. Whether one should publish packages which are likely only for personal use is another matter, in this case it seemed to make sense for me.</p><h2 id=error-messages-with-codes>Error messages (with codes)</h2><p>Rust errors seem to be universally described as easy to understand. While I think they&rsquo;re good, when coming from an interpreted language, there&rsquo;s still something of a learning curve. I found the error codes useful for doing a little extra reading when things didn&rsquo;t make sense (which happened quite often at the beginning).</p><h2 id=modules-make-sense>Modules make sense</h2><p>Over the last 4 years I&rsquo;ve been thrown in at the deep-end for various languages. Rust&rsquo;s system of modules and code imports from external packages stood out as one of the better ones - all helped along by Cargo. Certainly compared to Go (which I spent a similar amount of time with last Christmas), Rust and Cargo are far simpler than anything I could find at the time (glide seemed to be the best match).</p><h2 id=enum-types>Enum Types</h2><p>Rust has been my first real exposure to Enum types (I have only spent a very short while with Haskell). <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> are really satisfying to use and have helped me get better at reporting neat and meaningful errors (as opposed to rescuing a function call in Ruby). I have however found my code growing into a <em>Pillar of Doom</em>, while the <code>try!</code> macro can help, there are cases where I&rsquo;ve found this harder to resolve (when not all functions return a <code>Result</code>).</p><hr><p>I have also come across some areas that are a little rough around the edges. <em>Rustfmt</em> isn&rsquo;t at the same level as <em>Gofmt</em> and often seems to struggle with longer statements broken over multiple lines. I&rsquo;ve also found that the compiler times can grow quite quickly. I fear this is as much my fault for perhaps not including code with in the best way.</p><p>In summary, I&rsquo;m really liking Rust and I&rsquo;m keen to keep using it for future side projects.</p></div></section></body></html>
