sat via <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-assessment>computer</a> - students like
it for the instant results and teachers <strong>love</strong> the absence of any real
marking. While computer based testing can be handy, and has definite
potential, it currently has some very apparent short-comings.</p><p>There is really one type of question available: multiple choice. Any other
question types can become very ambiguous and extremely challenging to mark
(automatically). Take the question: <em>“What is the most demanding user interface
on system resources?”</em> as an example. Variations on the correct answer are
multiple: <em>Graphical, Graphical UI, Graphical Interface, Graphical User
Interface</em> and so on. Now imagine that with the common spelling mistakes or
case changes and you’ve got a marking nightmare on your hands. Multiple choice
it is then…</p><p>This is a problem though, there exists fundamental restrictions on what you can
ask with multiple choice. You might think that _‘complete the sentences’_would
work but candidates still pick up more marks on their own answer than
completing a given one. This would suggest that people need to explain things
in their own words to fully represent their understanding. This makes it
challenging to ask anything other than maths related questions, and even then
there are problems.</p><p>With maths though the issues aren’t as apparent and lurk behind the questions
themselves. You can’t have answers that are obviously wrong, why even bother
putting them in? You also want to try and stop people from just guessing. This
means that you have lots of plausible answers with penalty for getting the
wrong one. Lets assume we have a candidate who doesn’t guess and forgets one
step in a five step question - they’ve now had marks subtracted, fallen prey to
the guesser traps. Even when they did 80% of the question correct.</p></div></section></body></html>
