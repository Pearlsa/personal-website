It’s an app that gives you
access to spoken news on your mobile device. I get most of my news via twitter
these days, and while I’m quite happy with that system it’s sometimes nicer to
get a little more depth.</p><p>I’ve started listening to a few articles (each around 5 minutes) before I go to
bed. There’s a pretty good range in the ‘Geeky’ section and it’s kept
up-to-date. I’ve listened to interviews with Facebook engineers and some good
Google analysis - it’s generally been very good.</p><p>You have a playlist, one of them. You press and hold on a story in the library
to add it to your playlist. Then, on browsing to your playlist, you can wait
for all the articles to download over WiFi for later listening, or just listen
to them then and there.</p><p>There are a few problems that can make it a little awkward to use however.
Stories count as played too quickly which means you can loose some if you stop
5 seconds into the start to the playlist. Also when you select a story to
read the summary it shouldn’t start playing straight away - true you should be
able to play with it going into the playlist but it should be a choice. There
could also be more ways to sort and view the playlist.</p><p>I think it’s a great service  - I’ve certainly enjoyed using it - and I think
it’s got some potential with lazy readers like me. I’d recommend it.</p></div></section></body></html>
