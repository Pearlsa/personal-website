claim. I&rsquo;ve done this <a href=/posts/2016-06-24-getting-a-full-refund-for-a-faulty-macbook-under-uk-consumer-law/>once
before</a>
in 2016; now more familiar with the process I thought I&rsquo;d write up round two.</p><h2 id=tldr>TL;DR</h2><p>This isn&rsquo;t a short process so here&rsquo;s the summary.</p><p>If you have a Macbook on <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks>this list</a>
and you have a faulty keyboard, you can get a refund under EU consumer law.</p><p>You must have the original invoice. Order confirmations are not good enough,
invoices look like this and are sent as a PDF once an order is completed.</p><p><img src=invoice.png alt="my invoice"></p><ol><li>Get it verified as having a faulty keyboard and get the laptop back
<strong>unrepaired</strong>. The company needs to be an ASP (Apple Service Provider), it
can even be Apple Retail <em>iif</em> you bought your laptop from a non-Apple
company - it cannot be where you bought it from.</li><li>Contact Apple support if you purchased online or visit a store if you bought
it in <em>any</em> store (Apple Retail counts as the same entity here). Ask to start
the EU claims process <em>for refund</em> of a device under a repair program.</li><li>Follow their guidance but, send them the laptop.</li><li>Give bank deets</li><li>Profit?</li></ol><h2 id=my-timeline>My timeline</h2><p>This is the exact sequence of steps I completed.</p><p><strong>14th June 2016</strong></p><p>Bought my Macbook with the money from <a href=/posts/2016-06-24-getting-a-full-refund-for-a-faulty-macbook-under-uk-consumer-law/>my last EU consumer law claim</a> from the Apple Online Store.</p><p><strong>Sometime in 2017</strong></p><p>Had the keyboard replaced. (Note, this is not an essential step to get a refund)</p><p><strong>11th August 2019</strong></p><p>Laptop deposited at <a href=https://www.stormfront.co.uk/>Stormfront</a> Inverness.</p><p>Just ask for a diagnosis only, they charge some money for this service - I paid
Â£50. I think Apple can refund you for this too but I forgot to ask for it -
oops.</p><p>Make it really clear the laptop isn&rsquo;t to be repaired and that you are buying a
sheet of paper that says the device has a faulty keyboard - no more. This is
quite an unusual request so make it very clear.</p><p><strong>15th August</strong></p><p>I had all the paperwork describing the fault and my laptop returned. I had
originally hoped that Apple could work with Stormfront to have the laptop
collected but they needed the charger so it was easier to have it returned.</p><p><strong>20th August</strong></p><p>Began the EU claims procedure. Provided my invoice and told I&rsquo;d hear back within
a week.</p><p><strong>22nd August</strong></p><p>I have another call and provide the repair notes. They called at 2am but I
didn&rsquo;t answer so we spoke later in the day instead.</p><p>I had to speak to customer relations before they understood that this was to be
a refund rather than a repair. When you get to customer relations you know
you&rsquo;re in the right place and these folks are actually pretty great in my
experience. (Customer support != customer relations)</p><p><strong>23rd August</strong></p><p>Talked about setting up of TNT collection</p><p><strong>28th August</strong></p><p>TNT collection set up, advised they&rsquo;d call to arrange the collection.</p><p><strong>30th August</strong></p><p>TNT called, collection set for 6th of September</p><p><strong>6th September</strong></p><p>TNT arrived to collect but had no proof of collection. This meant we were unable
to complete the collection on this day.</p><p>On a call to TNT, we made arrangements to deposit the packaged laptop at the
depot.</p><p><strong>10th September</strong></p><p>Laptop dispatched and proof of sending given. This was sent to Apple via email
to customer relations.</p><p><strong>12th September</strong></p><p>Lacey (my CR rep) called to take my bank details (while I happened to be in Japan!).</p><p>I provided my Revolut details via email.</p><p><strong>16th September</strong></p><p>Lacey confirmed receipt of the bank details.</p><p>Apple need to have an IBAN number. This is not something available at Monzo
where I have my current account. Sadly, Revolut dropped the ball, see below&mldr;</p><p><strong>24th September</strong></p><p>Laura called while Lacey was on holiday. Payment sent for processing.</p><p><strong>30th September</strong></p><p>Lacey called to check if the money had arrived. It hadn&rsquo;t and she was to follow
up with the finance team.</p><p><strong>2nd October</strong></p><p>Another CR rep called to confirm my bank details.</p><p><strong>10th October</strong></p><p>Lacey called to say the payment had been reprocessed. Advised to wait 10
business days.</p><p><strong>15th October</strong></p><p>Lacey called to check if the payment had been received. It sadly had not.</p><p><strong>21st October</strong></p><p>10 days were up. Lacey called to check, action to follow up with accounts.</p><p><strong>23rd October</strong></p><p>Finance acknowledge the request to look into it. Expected to respond within 3
days.</p><p>I asked for a goodwill gesture due to the delay and was refused one.</p><p><strong>25th October</strong></p><p>Lacey called me to confirm that the payment had been rejected by Revolut.
Revolut never told me anything&mldr;</p><p>I sent my TransferWise details instead.</p><p><strong>29th October</strong></p><p>Call from Lacey to confirm that the new details had been submitted. Scheduled a
call back for the 12th to check.</p><p><strong>31st October</strong></p><p>Received the payment in my TransferWise account. Woop. Just in time for what
might have been Brexit - which might have impacted my rights to refund here?
(who knows&mldr;)</p><p><img src=refund.jpg alt="refund screenshot"></p><p>Emailed Lacey to request the case be closed, say thanks, good bye etc.</p><p><strong>2nd November</strong></p><p>Completed Apple feedback form suggesting better communication between customer
relations - as well as good feedback for Lacey and the process.</p><h2 id=lessons-learned>Lessons Learned</h2><p>Do</p><ul><li>&mldr;keep notes of call dates and what was agreed</li></ul><p>Don&rsquo;t</p><ul><li>&mldr;try and get the repair centre to liaise with Apple when sending back the
laptop (didn&rsquo;t realise the charger was required)</li><li>&mldr;use Revolut</li><li>&mldr;buy a butterfly keyboard Macbook and expect it to last more than 18 months</li></ul><h2 id=phew>Phew&mldr;</h2><p>This was a pretty painful process but mostly better than the last time. I had a
very good experience with the customer relations team. Having a single rep for
your case is a huge help.</p><p>I bought myself an iPhone with the proceeds this time. Phones are expensive
now&mldr;</p><p>Please contact me if you would like any more details, reference numbers etc.
